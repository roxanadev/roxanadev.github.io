[Tranquil theme](https://github.com/swang2015/tranquil-theme) ([demo](http://swang2015.github.io/tranquil-theme/)) is a stylish Jekyll template originally designed for [my blog](http://swang2015.github.io/).

- Homepage slider of feature posts
- Blog widgets
- Back to top button

## Quick-start guide

1. Assume you already installed Jekyll following [instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).
2. Fork and clone [tranquil-theme](https://github.com/swang2015/tranquil-theme.git).
3. Edit site options in `_config.yml`, create your own posts in `_post/`.
4. Run `jekyll serve` under site directory and your site is on now!

## Some notes

- edit your social accounts in `_data/social.yaml`
- assign ONE category for each post
- add `feature` into tags if you want to show post at homepage slider
- go to `images/` and place sidebar portrait pic and ads pic
- if [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) is enabled, use `\[...\]` for displayed mathematics and `\(...\)` for in-line mathematics
- ADVANCED: if you want to further customize your site, check out [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/) to understand how it works, also check out [html/css/javascript tutorials](http://www.w3schools.com/) and [liquid language](http://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to learn code.
